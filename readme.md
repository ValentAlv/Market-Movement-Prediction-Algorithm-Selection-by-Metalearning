# Market Movement Prediction Model Selection by Metalearning

## Abstract
The prediction of market price movement is an essential tool for decision-making in trading scenarios. However, there are several candidate methods for this task. Meta-learning can be an important ally for the automatic selection of of methods, which can be machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, named here classification algorithms. In this work, we present an empirical evaluation of the application of meta-learning for the selection of classification algorithms for the prediction of market price movement. Different setups and metrics were evaluated for the meta-target selection. Cumulative return was the metric that achieved the best results at the meta and base levels. According to the experimental results, meta-learning was a competitive selection strategy for the prediction of market price movement.
